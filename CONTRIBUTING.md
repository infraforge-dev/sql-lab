## üìù Code and Content Guidelines
- Prefer clear, simple language in problem statements and explanations.

- Note any SQL dialect differences (e.g., if a query is specific to SQL Server or PostgreSQL).

- Use comments in .sql files for clarity.

- Add sample data that‚Äôs easy to understand and run.

- If fixing an error, please describe the change in your PR.
